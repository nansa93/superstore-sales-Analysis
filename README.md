# superstore sales analysis

### Project Overview

The main aim of the project is to uncover insights into the store's sales and profits trends and patterns from 2020 to 2023. After cleaning and preprocessing the data, the profits trends were visualized by states, region, category, and sub-category. Additionally, top-performing products and the top customers were identified.

The following analysis discovered areas for improvement and offered insightful information on the Superstore's sales and profit performance.

### Data Sources

The Primary dataset used for this analysis is "superstore_data.csv".

### Tools

- Excel
  - Data Cleaning, Data Analysis and Creating Reports.
 
### **Goals**

In this step, we will define the business problem given to us which was interpreted as “What are the best products, regions, categories and customer segments for the Superstore to target or avoid in order to increase profitability?”

The Goal is to Maximize the Profit and Minimize the cost.

Business objectives:

How can we increase our profits?

Which new patterns are we able to recognize?

What new information can we gather so that we can make recommendations?

### Process

Since the file is already in CSV format, we will use Excel to analyze and clean our data.

1. Observe our data

2. Check for missing data with the help of conditional formating

3. Remove duplicate rows

While exploring our dataset, we can perform and notice the following;

Our data looks correct and consistent. Everything looks well-structured for further analysis it just needs a little editing.

With the use of conditional formating, which is a technique to highlight certain values of interest, we set our new formatting rule to be ‘Format only cells that contain’. Then we added on it to be ‘‘Format only cells with’: Blanks’. After that, we moved out to see our dataset from above. We can confirm that our dataset contains no missing values.

No situation involving data duplication with all the relevant settings for a customer in every column occurred once the command "remove duplicates" was used.Since each row included some variation, our data collection did not contain any duplicate data.

### Analyze

Find out the total transaction, total Profit, total Sales, total Quantity, total Discount.

- **Identify the top 10 States by Sales**
- **What are the Category-wise total profits and total sales?**
- **Identify Discount & Quantity by Sales**
- **Identify MOM % change in Profit**
- **What region generates the highest sales and profits?**
- **Identify Discount & Quantity by Segment**

### Results & Findings

In spite of an drop in sales in 2021, our financial performance has grown over the years, with each year being more profitable than the last.
Calculate Percentage of Profit (percentage of profit=profit/sales) ( 12% is the approximated percentage of profit generated).

### conclusion

**conclusions and future recommendations for the success of our Superstore:**
- Q4 was our most profitable quarter overall for the entire year.
- The West and East are the two regions with the best performance. The Central region generates lower earnings than the South region.
- Our biggest profits and active markets are California, New York, and Washington, particularly when it comes to state-level sales. We must give them greater attention. Three of our least profitable industries include Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Texas. Given that sales in Texas and Pennsylvania are in the $100,000s yet cannot be turned into profits.
- In terms of profitability, Office Supplies and Technology rank highest out of the three categories. Plus, their profit margins make them appear like a wise investment.Although they still turn a profit, furniture does not sell well overall. 
- California and New York yield the highest profits when it comes to technology and office supplies. For higher earnings, we must make these products more widely available in these states. However, our largest losses are in the areas of office supplies in Texas, technology in Ohio, and furniture in Texas and Illinois, so we must significantly cut down on these kinds of goods there.
- In terms of regional subcategories, we always need to keep binders in the West and copiers in the East and Accessories in the West on hand, as well as advertise them to increase profit.
When it comes to state-specific subcategories, New York is a great place for machines, phones, and binders. Accessories and binders come next in California and Michigan, respectively, therefore we must highlight those products in those markets to grow our business. Our largest losses come from binders in Texas and Illinois that have machines in Ohio that are completely unprofitable. We must reduce the amount of stock in those areas.
-The consumer segment generates the highest profit out of the three, followed by the corporate and home office segments.
